# Computational Design Programs
A community-driven list of worldwide programs on Computational Design (CD) topics.  Most of these programs focus on architecture and the built environment, but some of them are more in the arts. 

Programs are taught in English, unless otherwise noted. 

If you want to contribute, please feel free to submit a pull request. Keep the notes for each program as factual as possible. 

## MASTER DEGREES 

This list explictly excludes regular MArch programs that don't have some kind of emphasis on technology or computation.

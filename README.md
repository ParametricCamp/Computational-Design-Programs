# Computational Design Programs
A community-driven list of worldwide programs on Computational Design topics.



## MASTER DEGREES 

- [Master in Design Studies (MDes) - Mediums](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/design-studies/mediums/), Harvard GSD
  - This is the one where Jose Luis, from ParametricCamp, teaches! ðŸ¤“â›º
- [Master of Science in Architecture Studies (SMArchS)](https://architecture.mit.edu/computation), Computation, MIT
- [Master of Science in Design: Robotics and Autonomous Systems (MSD-RAS)](https://ras.design.upenn.edu/), UPenn
  - Jose Luis used to teach Advanced Robotic Programming here :)
- [Master of Science Programme Integrative Technologies and Architectural Design Research (ITECH)](https://www.itech.uni-stuttgart.de/), University of Stuttgart
  - This program has a very low tuition fee. 
- [Bachelor of Computational Design (Honours)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/study/undergraduate/bachelor-of-computational-design-honours), UNSW 
- [Master of Science in Computational Design](https://www.architecture.cmu.edu/computational-design), CMU
- [MAS ETH in Computational Structural Design (MAS ETH CSD)](https://sce.ethz.ch/en/programmes-and-courses/search-current-courses/mas/mas-eth-csd.html#Organiser), ETH
- [Master of Science in Computational and Advanced Design (MSc CAD)](https://designmorphine.com/education/designmorphine-masters-y23-24), UACEG
  - This is an online program ran by Mike Pryor from DesignMorphine.
- [Master of Science: Digital and Material Technologies (MSDMT)](https://taubmancollege.umich.edu/academics/architecture/master-of-science-in-architecture-design-and-research/), UMich
  - This one is fairly geared towards digital fabrication and robotics.
- [Architectural Computation MSc](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/architectural-computation-msc), UCL
- [Design for Performance & Interaction MArch](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/programmes/postgraduate/march-design-for-performance-and-interaction), UCL
- [Design for Manufacture MArch](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/programmes/postgraduate/march-design-for-manufacture), UCL
  - The two programs above are Masters in Architecture, but they have very strong computational content, for fabricatior or interaction. 
- [Master in Advanced Computation for Architecture & Design (MaCAD)](https://iaac.net/educational-programmes/masters-programmes/macad/), IAAC
- [Master in Robotics and Advanced Construction (MRAC)](https://iaac.net/educational-programmes/masters-programmes/master-in-robotics-and-advanced-construction-mrac/), IAAC

- [Emergent Technologies and Design (EMTECH)](https://emtech.aaschool.ac.uk/), AA
- [Computational Methods in Architecture (MSc)](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/msc-in-computational-methods-in-architecture), Cardiff University
- [Civil Engineering M.Sc.](https://www.tu.berlin/en/studying/study-programs/all-programs-offered/study-course/civil-engineering-m-sc), TUB
  - This one is perhaps less architecture-oriented, but more on the BIM and project management side. 
  - Taught in German only?

## DOCTORAL DEGREES
